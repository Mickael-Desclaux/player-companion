# 🧙‍♂️ Cool Adventures – D&D Companion Webapp

This project is a **companion app** I’m building to bring more fun, immersion, and fluidity to my Dungeons & Dragons sessions with friends.

## Features (planned & in progress)

- **Character sheets** – Keep track of stats, abilities, and equipment
- **Inventory & notes** – Manage loot, gold, and campaign notes
- **Minigames** – Dice roller, Baldur’s bones, drinking challenges, and more
- **Wheel of Chaos** – A random decision-maker for those “party cohesion” moments
- **Player view** – Each player can log in and access their own sheet

## Goal

The idea is to make sessions smoother by centralizing the **mechanical** (tracking sheets, loot, etc.) while adding a layer of **fun randomness** with minigames that fit the D&D vibe.

## Tech stack (early draft)

- **TypeScript everywhere** (front & back)
- **Next.js** (React, SSR, and API routes)
- **TailwindCSS** for UI
- **Supabase + Prisma** for database and auth
- **Socket.IO / Realtime** for multiplayer interactions

## Status

This is a work in progress. Expect experiments, broken features, and lots of dice rolls 🎲.
